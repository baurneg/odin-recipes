    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>½ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs</ul>
    <ul>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon salt</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</ul>
    <ul>½ cup all-purpose flour</ul>
    <ul>1 egg</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon lemon juice</ul>
    <ul>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</ul>
    <ul>½ cup pizza sauce, divided</ul>
    <ul>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</ul>
    <ul>4 slices pepperoni, or to taste - divided</ul>
</p>
<p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, salt, and black pepper in a shallow bowl; place flour into a second bowl. Whisk egg and lemon juice together in a third bowl.</li>
        <li>Dip each chicken breast in egg mixture and dredge in flour; dip again in egg mixture and dredge chicken in crumb mixture until coated. Place coated chicken breasts into a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is heated through and crumbs are golden, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spoon 2 tablespoons pizza sauce onto each chicken breast, sprinkle each with half the mozzarella cheese, and top each with half the pepperoni slices.</li>
        <li>Bake until chicken is no longer pink inside and the juices run clear, about 10 more minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
